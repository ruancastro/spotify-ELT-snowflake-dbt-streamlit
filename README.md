## 📖 Overview

> **Architecture Note**  
> This project follows a **hybrid medallion architecture** where **Snowflake is the primary data warehouse**, responsible for storing and processing all curated layers — Bronze, Silver, and Gold.  
>
> The flow operates as follows:
> - Raw JSON data lands first in **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** as Bronze snapshots.
> - Snowflake ingests these Bronze files and **materializes an incremental Bronze table**.
> - dbt transforms Bronze → Silver → Gold **inside Snowflake**, where all curated data is stored and queried.
> - Silver & Gold are also **exported to GCS (Parquet)** only as *resilient backups* and for future portability (BigQuery, DuckDB, Databricks, Polars, etc.).
>
> This ensures:
> - **Full analytical power and long-term storage in Snowflake**  
> - **Durable, portable backups in GCS**  
> - A decoupled architecture where Snowflake is the warehouse and transformation engine, while GCS provides raw ingestion and long-term durability.

This project implements a modern ELT pipeline that extracts daily artist insights from the Spotify API, stores raw JSON in GCS, transforms data in Snowflake using dbt, and exposes insights through a Streamlit dashboard.

The pipeline includes:

- serverless ingestion (Cloud Run Jobs)
- CI/CD orchestration (GitHub Actions)
- ELT modeling with dbt (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- analytics stored and computed in Snowflake
- visualization via Streamlit

## 🎄 Dataset Scope

This project tracks **Christmas-related Spotify artists and their top tracks** during the **2025 holiday season**, focusing on the period from **November to December 2025**.

The dataset includes:

- A curated list of **globally and Brazil-relevant Christmas artists**
- Daily snapshots of:
  - artist popularity and follower counts
  - top tracks per artist
  - track popularity evolution over time
- Historical tracking to capture **seasonality and popularity spikes** as Christmas approaches

The goal is to analyze how Christmas music consumption evolves over time, compare markets (Global vs Brazil), and identify the most dominant artists and tracks during the holiday season.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

## 🚀 Pipeline Automation (GitHub Actions)

This project uses two workflows for modularity and clarity.

---

### 1️⃣ Daily Ingestion Workflow (Spotify → GCS)

Runs on schedule via GitHub Actions:

- Executes Cloud Run Job
- Cloud Run container:
  - Calls Spotify API
  - Extracts artist & track data
  - Writes raw snapshots to GCS Bronze folder

Example paths: \
`gs://<bucket>/bronze/artists/YYYY-MM-DD/snapshot.json` \
`gs://<bucket>/bronze/tracks/YYYY-MM-DD/snapshot.json`

---

### 2️⃣ Daily Transformation Workflow (dbt → Snowflake)

GitHub Actions executes:

- `dbt deps`
- `dbt run`
- `dbt test`

Snowflake produces:

- **Bronze**: incremental ingestion tables  
- **Silver**: cleaned entities  
- **Gold**: analytical aggregates and KPIs  

---

## 📊 Data Flow Summary

1. **Extract:** Spotify → Cloud Run → GCS (raw JSON Bronze)
2. **Load to Warehouse:** Snowflake loads Bronze snapshots
3. **Transform:** dbt on Snowflake (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
4. **Persist:** Silver & Gold **stored in Snowflake**
5. **Backup:** Silver & Gold **exported to GCS (Parquet)**
6. **Visualize:** Streamlit querying Snowflake

---

## 📚 Project Goals
